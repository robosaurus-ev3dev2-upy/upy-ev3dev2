# upy-ev3dev2
Main repo to contain submodules of other repos, as well as build scripts

The purpose of this "Orgnization" is to improve ev3dev2 running in Micropython.

ev3dev2 provides Python environment on Lego EV3, which would something the kids in our FLL team (Robosaurus) would like to explore.

However, python3 starts so so so so so so slow, which makes the environment not suitable for using during FLL competetion.
Fortunately there is also Micropython. So far ev3dev2 running in Micropython supports most of the sensors and motors on EV3, with the exception of buttons, sound, and diplay.

Buttons would be pretty useful during the robot game so we do need them.
Sound is pretty interesting, especially the ability of calling espeak from the python program makes the kids a lot more interested in programming. So would like to have it.
Display is good, but looks like a little bit too complicated for now. Will postpone it.

As a coach of the FLL team, I would like to have the kids to do things. However, this I guess is too hard for a bunch of 10-year-olds. So I am going to help. :)
